# castles
Technical assignment for how many castles to build.

Please find the function for finding how many castles should be built in the castles/js/castles.js file.

The script can be run by running castles/index.html in the castles directory.

Please put the integers array in the index.html file, there is an example in the file where the data should be put.  
I have also included a few examples with different scenarios.
